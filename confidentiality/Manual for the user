Hi user!
Here you are a little guideline in order to execute correctly the project.
First of all run two instances of the terminal.

In the first one digit the following command './makeAndRunServer.sh'
In this way the code will be compiled and the server will be started.

In the second one digit './client'. In this way the client will be executed and s(she) will connect to the server. After a fraction of second, the session, between client and server will be ready.

The server starts with the conversation and then the client can answer.

With this version there a ping-pong conversation between the two entities.


Enjoy it!
